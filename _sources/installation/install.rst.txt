Installation
============

|graphnet|\ GraphNeT is available for Python 3.8 to Python 3.11.

.. note::
   We recommend installing |graphnet|\ GraphNeT in a separate environment, e.g. using a Python virtual environment or Anaconda (see details on installation `here <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_).

Quick Start

When installation is completed, you should be able to run `the examples <https://github.com/graphnet-team/graphnet/tree/main/examples>`_.

Installation in CVMFS (IceCube)
-------------------------------

You may want |graphnet|\ GraphNeT to be able to interface with IceTray, e.g., when converting I3 files to a deep learning friendly file format, or when deploying models as part of an IceTray chain. In these cases, you need to install |graphnet|\ GraphNeT in a Python runtime that has IceTray installed.

To achieve this, we recommend installing |graphnet|\ GraphNeT into a CVMFS with IceTray installed, like so:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   # Download GraphNeT
   git clone https://github.com/graphnet-team/graphnet.git
   cd graphnet
   # Open your favorite CVMFS distribution
   eval `/cvmfs/icecube.opensciencegrid.org/py3-v4.2.1/setup.sh`
   /cvmfs/icecube.opensciencegrid.org/py3-v4.2.1/RHEL_7_x86_64/metaprojects/icetray/v1.5.1/env-shell.sh
   # Update central utils
   pip install --upgrade pip>=20
   pip install wheel setuptools==59.5.0
   # Install graphnet into the CVMFS as a user
   pip install --user -r requirements/torch_cpu.txt -e .[torch,develop]


Once installed, |graphnet|\ GraphNeT is available whenever you open the CVMFS locally.

Installation with km3io (KM3NeT)
-----------------------------------------------

This installation is only necessary if you want to process KM3NeT/ARCA or KM3NeT/ORCA files. Processing means converting them from a `.root` offline format into a suitable format for training using |graphnet|. If you already have your KM3NeT data in `SQLite` or `parquet` format and only want to train a model or perform inference on this database, this specific installation is not needed.

Note that this installation will add `km3io`, `km3db`, and `km3pipe`, ensuring they are built with compatible versions. The steps below are provided for a conda environment, but feel free to choose a different enviroment setup.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create an environment with Python 3.8
   conda create -p <path-to-env> python=3.8 -c conda-forge -y
   # Activate the environment and install dependencies
   cd graphnet
   # Choose the appropriate requirements file based on your system
   pip install -r requirements/torch_cpu.txt -e .[torch,develop]
   # or
   pip install -r requirements/torch_cu118.txt -e .[torch,develop]
   # or
   pip install -r requirements/torch_cu121.txt -e .[torch,develop]
   
   # Install the correct versions of KM3NeT-related libraries
   pip install km3io==1.1.0 km3db==0.11.3 kmpipe==9.13.9
   # Downgrade setuptools for compatibility
   pip install --force-reinstall setuptools==70.3.0

.. note::
   We recommend installing |graphnet|\ GraphNeT without GPU in clean metaprojects.
